# 🎬 Movie Rating App

A simple React-based movie rating app that allows users to explore, rate, and track movies. The app fetches movie data using the **OMDb API** and includes features like pagination, React Router for navigation, and a fake login system. It uses **Redux** for state management, making it efficient for handling global state. However, **Context API + useReducer** could also be used as an alternative for a smaller-scale app, but Redux is implemented here for learning purposes.

## 🔗 API Integration

This app fetches movie data from the **OMDb API**. 


## 💡 Why Redux Instead of Context API + useReducer?
Since this project is also being used for **learning Redux**, Redux is implemented for managing global state. However, for a **small-scale** app, **Context API + useReducer** could be a simpler alternative. The purpose of using Redux here is to practice real-world state management patterns and middleware integration.
